<h1>HowTo - use tkbibtex under MacOS</h1>
<p>The following has been successfully done under MacOS 9.0.4 (german 
version). It should run under other version, though (what about
MacOS X?).</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Tcl/Tk. You will find it
<a href="http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/downloadnow83.html">here</a>.
Please note that I have only tested the complete
<a 
href="http://dev.scriptics.com/download/tcl/mac/TclTk_8_3_2p1_RtimeInstall.bin"> binary
installer</a>.</li>
<li>Download tkbibtex and save it with a filename of tkbibtex.tcl (or 
whatever).</li>
<li>Drag and drop this file onto the alias "Drag & Drop Tclets" in the 
Tcl/Tk folder. If you use Tcl/Tk for the first time, you will be asked to locate 
the "Wish" application which can be found in the "Build" subfolder.</li>
<li>You will then be asked to name and save your Tcl application. Just do 
so!</li>
<li>Start the newly created application as any other one using all the 
comfort the MacOS provides you with (exception see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all!</p>

<h2>Limitations and problems</h2>
Some limitations and problems I encountered (plus one wish):
<ul>
<li>I had some problems when installing Tcl/Tk on another than the 
system hard drive: after a restart of the computer, Tcl-scripts would not 
run because the scripting engine was not found any more (??).
With the standard installation on the system hard drive, everything runs just fine.</li>
<li>Although you can drag and drop any bib-file onto the newly created 
application, the bib-file is not opened automatically. You have to use the 
open dialog in the file menu.</li>
<li>Being no Tcl expert, I could not figure out how to bind the standard 
MacOS keys to the objects in the file menu (Open, Save, etc.). Modifying 
the corresponding line in the tkbibtex source code just did not do the job!</li>
</ul>
